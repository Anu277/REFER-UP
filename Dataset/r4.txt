Subject: Seeking a Referral for a Job Opportunity

Hello ENAME,

Trust this message finds you in good health. 

I'm YNAME, currently a YWORK at YPLACE. I trust things are going well at your end.

I'm reaching out because I'm actively exploring opportunities in the job market and I'm excited to reach the next step in my career journey. While exploring roles in the YJOB sector, I stumbled upon an opening at your esteemed company that resonated with me profoundly. 

The position in question is for a YROLE. Given your extensive network and illustrious experience in the YJOB industry, I was hoping to discuss the possibility of you vouching for me through a referral.

With YX years under my belt in the YROLE domain, I've cultivated a solid skill set that I'm eager to bring to a new team.

For your convenience, I've attached my resume. If there's any additional information you require, I'd be more than happy to provide it.

Looking forward to the chance of connecting.

Warm regards,

-YFNAME
